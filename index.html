    <h2>Can We Trust SmartSTP Reviews? 🌐</h2>

    <h2>Who Owns SmartSTP? 🔒</h2>

    <h2>How SmartSTP Makes Traders Lose Money 💰❌</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>High spreads:</strong> The basic account starts with <span class="highlight">2.5 pips</span>, making profitable trading difficult.</li>
        <li><strong>Withdrawal issues:</strong> Clients report that SmartSTP <span class="highlight">delays or denies withdrawals</span>.</li>
        <li><strong>Market maker model:</strong> The broker profits from traders’ losses, meaning they have <span class="highlight">no incentive</span> for you to succeed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Is SmartSTP a Scam? 🛑</h2>
